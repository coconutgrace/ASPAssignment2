                    As a co-op, it is possible to provide boats, equipment and sailing skill development at a fraction of the cost of any other sailing program you can find. The low cost, however, does require full participation of the members to make it succeed. All members are expected to contribute time for boat maintenance or helping with other activities toward our common goal.

       @* <h2>THE FLEET</h2>*@
        <ul>
            <li>All our vessels are great all-around sailboats, with large cockpits, comfortable cabins, sleep at least 4 and are perfect for sailing in Semiahmoo Bay or cruising the Gulf Islands. All have required safety equipment, VHS marine radios, roller furling foresails, marine heads with holding tanks and many other amenities.</li>
            <li>Our priority is to keep the fleet in safe and seaworthy condition. Annual bottom painting and upgrades are usually accomplished at the beginning of each sailing season and the boats are maintained on an ongoing basis throughout the year by assigned teams of members. Sails, outboards, rigging, docking lines etc are replaced on an ongoing basis as needed.</li>
